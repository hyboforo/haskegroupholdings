# Haske Group Holdings — haskegroupholdings.com

Next.js site exported as static files and served by Cloudflare. No server, database or environment variables are needed.

## Before launch

1. Edit **`lib/site.ts`**: emails, address, and everything in [square brackets] or marked `TODO`.
2. Search the rest of the code for placeholders:
   ```
   findstr /s /n /c:"TODO" /c:"[" app\*.tsx lib\*.ts components\*.tsx
   ```
3. Run `npm run build` and fix any errors before deploying.

## Run locally

```
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000, hot reload
npm run preview    # builds, then serves out/ on Cloudflare's local runtime
```

## Deploy, option A: Git + Cloudflare (recommended)

Every push to `main` redeploys the site automatically.

1. Push this folder to its own GitHub repository.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages → Create → Import a repository** and pick the repo.
3. Use these settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`
   - Root directory: `/` (the repo root)
4. Deploy. You'll get a `*.workers.dev` URL to check first.

## Deploy, option B: from your computer

```
npx wrangler login
npm run deploy
```

## Connect the domain

1. The domain **haskegroupholdings.com** must be on Cloudflare (Add a domain → change nameservers at your registrar).
2. In the Worker, go to **Settings → Domains & Routes → Add → Custom domain** and add both
   `haskegroupholdings.com` and `www.haskegroupholdings.com`.
3. The site's canonical URL is `https://www.haskegroupholdings.com` (set in `lib/site.ts`). To send the bare domain there,
   add a redirect rule: **Rules → Redirect Rules → Redirect from root to WWW** template.

## What's configured

- `wrangler.jsonc`: serves `out/` as static assets, with the custom 404 page.
- `public/_headers`: security headers, and long-term caching for hashed build files.
- `.node-version`: Node 22 for Cloudflare's build.
- `app/opengraph-image.png`: the image shown when a link is shared on WhatsApp, LinkedIn or X.
- `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`: generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
- Fonts are self-hosted from npm, so the site makes no third-party requests.
